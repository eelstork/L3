# Thinking beyond block coding

Not sure if now is the best time but, experimenting with block coding reminded me of something: it's not obvious that coding is the best approach to the kind of AI I am wanting to build.

Also, building environments... this can be done efficiently in first person.

Instead, having agents learn by example would be expected to give much better results, faster. Essentially the designer just play the part of an NPC, and we roll from there.

Looping the loop though, this "by example" approach would also help flesh out pretty much any kind of code, in the sense that, a record of working through a small version of the problem manually should be a good starting point for coding.

Then we can edit this and flesh out the procedural aspects.
