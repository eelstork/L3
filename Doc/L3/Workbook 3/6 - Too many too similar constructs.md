# Too many too similar constructs

...is how I feel right now. Just implementing this language feels like doing the same thing over, and over, and over, again.

Even so there are not that many constructs... I have 8, plus 3 literals.

They are:

Call, Class, Composite, Field, Function, New, Unit and Var

I would prefer Function and Unit to be composites. Well, this is no big deal.

New, Call and Var feel like they are doing similar jobs. Or put another way I would prefer Var to not exist at all, use call instead.
