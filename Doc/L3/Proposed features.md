## Loops in L3

The idea here is to have argument loops, similar to NUnit... I guess.

This is a different take on traversals; here the idea is that we have several collections, which are passed as arguments to functions which take singletons. So this is essentially putting loops inside expressions, which I suspect is the better way to do things.

Another instances of "content first" thinking.
